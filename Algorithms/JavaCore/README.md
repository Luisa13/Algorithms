## Java Core
The topics covered in this part are listed below but may serves as a reference [this link](https://education.oracle.com/java-se-11-developer/pexam_1Z0-819?intcmp=WWOUBLOGPOSTLADJAVA082913).


#### Data Types
* -[X] Primitives and wrapper classes, including, operators, parentheses, type promotion and casting
* -[X] String and StringBuilder classes
* -[X] Local variable type inference, including as lambda parameters

#### Java Object-Oriented Approach
* -[ ] Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects explaining objects' lifecycles (including creation, dereferencing by reassignment, and garbage collection)
* -[ ] Define and use fields and methods, including instance, static and overloaded methods
* -[ ] Initialize objects and their members using instance and static initialiser statements and constructors
* -[ ] Variable scopes, applying encapsulation and make objects immutable.
* -[ ] Create and use subclasses and superclasses, including abstract classes
* -[ ] Polymorphism and casting to call methods, differentiate object type versus reference type
* -[ ] Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default methods
* -[ ] Create and use enumerations

#### Exception Handling
* -[X] Custom exceptions.
* -[X] Handle exceptions using try/catch/finally clauses, try-with-resource, and multi-catch statements

#### Arrays and Collections
* -[ ] Use generics, including wildcards
* -[ ] Sort collections and arrays using Comparator and Comparable interface
* -[ ] Use a Java array and List, Set, Map and Deque collections, including convenience methods

#### Streams and Lambda expressions
* -[ ] Implement functional interfaces using lambda expressions, including interfaces from the java.util.function package
* -[ ] Perform decomposition and reduction, including grouping and partitioning on sequential and parallel streams
* -[ ] Use Java Streams to filter, transform and process data

#### Concurrency
* -[ ] Create worker threads using Runnable and Callable, and manage concurrency using an ExecutorService and java.util.concurrent API
* -[ ] Develop thread-safe code, using different locking mechanisms and java.util.concurrent API

#### Java I/O API
* -[ ] Handle file system objects using java.nio.file API
* -[ ] Read and write console and file data using I/O Streams
* -[ ] Implement serialization and deserialization techniques on Java objects
