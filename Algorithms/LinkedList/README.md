## **LINKED LISTS**

#### **Advantages**
Use this data structure if you run into a situation with:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient **Insertion/ Deletion** (O(1) if you don´t mind the order, in which case is O(n))

#### **Drawbacks**
- Inefficient random access. You will have to traverse previous nodes until reach what you´re looking for.
- Extra memory space for pointers
- Inefficient for **searching**
