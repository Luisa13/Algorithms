## **Stacks & Queues**

### Applications and important points
- Are designed to enforce the processing of data elements in **some order**.
- **Parsing**, as arithmetic expression evaluation
- Function-call abstraction. To call a function, push the state on a stack. To return from a function call, pop the state from the stack to restore all 
- variables to their values before the function call and resume execution at the next instruction to be executed.
- [M/M/1](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/43stack/MM1Queue.java.html) problem model.
- [Load Balancing](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/43stack/LoadBalance.java.html) where simulate the process of assigning n items to a set of m servers
