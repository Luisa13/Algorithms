# Recursion

## Backtracking
This is a technique to solve problems recursively, that look for every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. It adds one option at time, and removes those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
Some types of problems can be tacked with backtracking:
- Decision problems: Searching for **a** feasible solution.
- Optimization problems: Searching for **the best** solution. 
- Enumeration problems: Searching for **all possibles** solutions.

However, normaly is not the best solution, as the algorithm runs exponentially in both, time and space.
