 * Robot in a Grid: Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. 
 * The robots can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are 'off limits' such that
 * the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find the path for the robot from the top left to 
 * the bottom right.
