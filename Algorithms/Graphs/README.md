# Graphs
Some topic covered:

### Graph Basics
Main ways to traverse a graph: DFS and BFS.

### Union Find
Performs operations in a disjoint sets in order to identify if problems talks about finding groups or components.
- Count the number of disjoint sets.
- Find the reduntant connection.
- Number of operation to make a network connected.

### Depth First Search
- Island count and island variants.
- Shortest time.

### Breadth First Search
- Shortest path*.
- Coloring graph.
- Bipartition.

### Detect Cycle
- DFS approach.
- Topological Sort approach
- Floyd approach


### Topological Sort
Given a directed acylic graph, the topological sort is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
