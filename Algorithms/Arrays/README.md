## **Arrays**

#### Advantages
- Random access
- Memory might be dinamically allocated, but depends on the [implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-vs-arraylist-in-java/)
- Is cache friendly since their elements are stored near each other as well as their use in memory is more compacted.
- Easier to perform classic search/sort algorithms

#### Drawbacks
- Insert/Delete elements is quite inefficient
